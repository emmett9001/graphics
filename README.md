Computer Graphics Experiments
=============================

This repository contains a collection of my recent explorations of 3d graphics. It comprises a growing collection of Java applets, each exhibiting some step of my learning in fields incluing rendering, matrix math, kinematics, dynamics, and projection.

These applets can be viewed online at http://emmettbutler.com/graphics
